# brightway-shine

This file links to other repositories outside the brightway-lca organization where the brightway code is extended or used.  

If you have a project that does this, please go ahead and add it here.

## Repositories that *extend* brightway
These repositories add some functionality to the core brightway-lca code base. 

### presamples
Package to write, load, manage and verify numerical arrays, called presamples.  

Presamples can replace values in the matrices used in LCA as calculations are carried out. This integration is seamless in brightway2: 

```python
lca = bw.LCA({act:1}, presamples=[list_of_paths_to_presample_packages])
```

Storing and injecting specific values in LCA matrices can improve LCA calculations in many ways:

  * Storing and reusing data characterizing given scenarios makes scenario analysis much easier.
  * It can easily integrate time series.
  * It can use pre-generated static or stochastic values that were generated by complex, non-linear models, allowing the
    LCA model to capture system dynamics more accurately.
  * It is possible to account to correlation across parameters during Monte Carlo Simulations (e.g. for correlation
    between characterization factors, between fuel use and CO2 emissions, etc.
  * Since sampled data can be used directly, it is unnecessary to fit data to a distribution.

Presamples can also store parameters used in parameterized brightway models.

### brightway2-aggregated
This package provides tools for the creation and use of aggregated (i.e. cradle-to-gate) LCA data, both at the LCI and LCIA score level.

### bw2landbalancer
bw2landbalancer is a Python library used to create balanced land transformation samples to override unbalanced sample.

Unbalanced samples arise when land transformation exchanges are independently sampled. bw2landbalancer rescales certain land transformation exchanges to ensure that the ratio of land transformation from exchanges and land transformation to exchanges is conserved. It is based on the Brightway2 LCA framework, and is meant to be used with [presamples](https://github.com/PascalLesage/presamples).

### bw2waterbalancer
bw2waterbalancer is a Python library used to create balanced water samples to override unbalanced sample.

Unbalanced samples arise when water exchanges are independently sampled. bw2waterbalancer rescales certain exchanges to ensure that the ratio of water inputs to water outputs is conserved. It is based on the Brightway2 LCA framework, and is meant to be used with [presamples](https://github.com/PascalLesage/presamples)..
